# Demand-forecasting-for-restaurant-chain

The main goal for this project is to use machine learning models to forecast daily sales for each restaurant outlet based on historical data and other factors that influences the sales as follows:
  1. Customer Counts
  2. Weather
  3. Promotions and Discounts
  4. Day of the week and month

**Problem Statement:**

A multi-location network of restaurants is interested in predicting consumer demand in order to enhance its day-to-day operations and strategic planning.

Predict daily sales for each location using internal historic operational data, and a small number od external influencing sources, to improve decision making in relation to inventory, labor and marketing planning.

**Data Sources:**

-Internal transactional records: Sales, orders, Customer counts

-Operational calender: Promotions, Events, Holidays

-External data: Weather conditions
